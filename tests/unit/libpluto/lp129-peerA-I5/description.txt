This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
It is called "I5", but it is really the second peer I3 state, after peerA-I3.

The client peerA will use it's certificate to authenticate.
The response from lp128-R2 should have this initiator attempt to eroute both
policies to ::/0, and may show the vtinum challenge.

There is a bug in that this rekey is seen as a duplicate, and one state is
removed.  This check should be avoided because the rekey is recognized as
a rekey, but the pluto does not at this time send the right rekey NOTIFICATION.
