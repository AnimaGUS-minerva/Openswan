This test case is an IKEv2 responder -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.
This is identical to lp122-peerB-R1, except that it is peerC, rather than peerB.

This is a critical test of peerA's ability to negotiate identical policies
with two peers.
