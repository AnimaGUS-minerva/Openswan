This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
It has initiated to peerB, and completed things in lp125.
THEN, the peer decides to initiate a rekey (in lp130).

In production, this results in a passert failure at:
    /osw/t11228-xfrm-with-vti/programs/pluto/connections.c:1456: match_id(his_id, &d->spd.that.id, &wildcards)

This test case attempts to reproduce this, so that it can be fixed.
This is where the originally initiator receives the rekey I2 message, and
this is where the error should be.
