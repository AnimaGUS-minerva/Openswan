This test case is an IKEv2 initiator -- the client peerA will use it's
certificate to authenticate.

This is the start (I1) of a simultaneous init by peerA and peerB.
It is identical to the lp12* sequence.

The Nonce in each direction is tweaked to be unique by the so_serial_t, using
seam_ikev2_sendI1n.c.
