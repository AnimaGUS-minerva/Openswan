This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
It has initiated to peerB, and completed things in lp125.
THEN, the peer decides to initiate a rekey (in lp130).

In production, this results in a passert failure at:
    /osw/t11228-xfrm-with-vti/programs/pluto/connections.c:1456: match_id(his_id, &d->spd.that.id, &wildcards)

This test case attempts to reproduce this, so that it can be fixed.
