This test case is an IKEv2 initiator -- the client peerA will use it's
certificate to authenticate.

This is the third step for simultaneous init.
lp141, peerA creates the init.
lp143, peerA processes peerB's I1 (replies with R1).
lp145, peerA processes PeerB's R1 from it's I1, and also receives peerB's R2 reply.
