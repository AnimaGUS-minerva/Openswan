This test case is an IKEv2 initiator -- the client peerA will use it's
certificate to authenticate.

This is the third step for simultaneous init.
lp141, peerA creates the init.
lp143, peerA processes peerB's I1 (replies with R1).
lp145, peerA processes PeerB's R1 from it's I1, and also receives peerB's R2 reply.

This is a duplicate of test lp147, but with kernel interfaces included.

The peer will decide to delete one of the states, and this side needs to
slip the policy in for the surviving state into place.
