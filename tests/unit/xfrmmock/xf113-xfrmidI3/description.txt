This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
It tests crypto operations along the entire path, and it shows the
XFRM Tunnel Interface (if_id) value sent into the kernel.
The XFRM if_id value is a special context for policy evaluation
that determine which policy is applied.

Bugs in Kernels up to 6.1 (at least), mean that exceptions are still needed
for IPv6-LL / ICMP ND messages.

This test specifically captures the netlink commands which are sent
and validates that the IPsec (CHILD, phase2) derived keys and algorithms are
sane.
It differs from XF13-parentI3, in that the XFRM ID value is forced in.
