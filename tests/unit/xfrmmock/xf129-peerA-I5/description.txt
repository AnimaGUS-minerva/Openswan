This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
It is called "I5", but it is really the second peer I3 state, after peerA-I3.

The client peerA will use it's certificate to authenticate.
The response from lp128-R2 should have this initiator attempt to eroute both
policies to ::/0, and may show the vtinum challenge.
